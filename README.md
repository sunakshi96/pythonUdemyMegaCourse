So let me get this straight and give you an insight to what this repo is all about. Last semester I found this really cool course on udemy called Python Mega Course: Build the 10 real world applications!! and that too under the discount rate of Rs. 460 !(sounds quite attractive is n't it?).Hell yeah!!!!

Following is the list of the applications built during the learning.

__1. Interactive Dictionary__
    This week after revisiting the python lectures on udemy and reconceptualizing the fundamental knowledge I threw myself into the first and my favourite (application of the course), the Interactive dictionary. This dictionary is the simplest of its kind yet intelligent. Naa! It is not an AI application, but yes it uses a cool "instead of" feature similar to the "google search".
    
   - _JSON format_: 
    It uses the json format for storing data (like python dictionary) in Key-value pairs
   - _Counting for non existing words_:
    When the word requested is not present in the dictionary, instead of throwing error it handles it by printing relevant message.
   - _Making program case sensitive_:
    Offers users a flexible utility, even when the case of the letters are not proper. For example: "rAin" is interpreted as "rain"
   - _Calculating Similarity Ratio_:
    Yeah Baby! This is what we were waiting for, the feature which was mentioned above similar to  Google Search! It takes the dictionary to the next level by suggesting users alternative word in case of a spell mistake. It does so by choosing the word which has maximum similarity ratio between the incorrect word.
   - _User Interface_:
    Here is the fall!! The interface of the application is kept for future work. Presently one can run this on terminal which is damn cooler than the GUI (Linux users...Support Me buddies!!! :| ) Just run the command python3 app1.py and feel the magic!
